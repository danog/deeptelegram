  "body": "## Deep Telegram messenger for Android\r\n\r\nThis repo contains the official source code for [Deep Telegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.deeptelegram.messenger).\r\n\r\nHello!\r\nI have created another fork of the telegram app that allows you to access the deep telegram!\r\nThe deep telegram is like a second unexplored telegram hosted on secondary testing servers.  \r\n\r\nOn deep telegram you can create up to two channels/groups with public usernames.\r\n\r\nOn deep telegram the limit for supergroups is of 20 users, while we still haven't reached the limit for normal groups.  \r\n\r\nIf you try to upgrade a normal group with more than 20 users to a supergroup telegram will randomly kick users to stay within the 20 users limit of supergroups. Note that bots won't be kicked.\r\n\r\nOn deep telegram the equivalent of @botfather is @father_bot\r\n\r\nOn deep telegram the following official bots are present: @sticker, @spambot, @like, @vote.\r\n@gif and @vid are also present but they don't work.\r\nIn deep pwrtelegram, @vote and @like work in channels (ergo the callback data)!\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously the official bot API cannot be used to interface with bots since it connects to the main telegram servers, but if you use the @pwrtelegram app (after switching backend of course) you can login as a bot.\r\nI managed to install the pwrtelegram API in deep telegram. \r\nTo run bots in deep telegram you just have to create a bot @father_bot and then access it using the Deep PWRTelegram bot API.\r\nLike the original bot API, it can upload/download files up to 1.5 gb, features anonymous downloads and much more!\r\nSee https://pwrtelegram.xyz for the full documentation of the API (it's pretty much the same as the official bot API).\r\nThe main API endpoint is https://deepapi.pwrtelegram.xyz, \r\nThe main storage endpoint is https://deepstorage.pwrtelegram.xyz.\r\n\r\nSee pwrtelegram.xyz for more details.\r\n\r\nSecret chats work properly on deep telegram.\r\n\r\nIf you're spamreported on telegram, you will be spamreported on deep telegram.\r\nIf you're spamreported on deep telegram, you won't be spamreported on telegram.\r\nLooks like telegram spamreports are extended to deep telegram only if they are permanent.\r\n\r\nOn deep telegram channels can have max 3 admins.\r\n\r\nTo access deep telegram on iOS, windows phone and other systems use telegram web with the ?test=1 query string.\r\nhttps://web.telegram.org?test=1\r\n\r\nI've finished writing https://telegram.me/deepbridgebot, now you can use it to transfer files and messages from telegram to deep telegram and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniil Gentili",
